/**
 * Attach an `'error'` listener to a checked-out {@link PoolClient} for the
 * lifetime of the checkout, returning a function that detaches it.
 *
 * node-postgres emits `'error'` on the **Client** (not the Pool) when a
 * checked-out client's backend connection dies while it is idle between
 * queries — e.g. an idle-TCP kill by a pooler/NAT, a backend restart, or a
 * `pg_terminate_backend`. Crucially, `pg-pool` *removes* its own pool-level
 * idle `'error'` listener from the client on checkout (`_acquireClient`) and
 * only re-adds it on release (`_release`), so during the checkout window the
 * client has no `'error'` listener at all. Without one, Node escalates the
 * event to an uncaughtException and crashes the process:
 *
 *   Error: Connection terminated unexpectedly
 *   ... Emitted 'error' event on Client instance ...
 *
 * Pool-level `'error'` handlers do NOT cover this case. This handler does.
 *
 * The guard's lifetime is scoped to the checkout: `pg-pool` assigns a fresh
 * `release` to the client on every checkout, so we wrap *that* `release` and
 * detach when it is called. On detach we remove our listener and restore the
 * original `release`, so:
 *   - the guard never runs alongside pg-pool's restored idle listener after
 *     release (no double handling),
 *   - a reused pooled client is re-guarded on its next checkout with that
 *     checkout's logger (no stale logger), and
 *   - clients from user-provided/shared pools are left exactly as they were.
 * The original `release` is still invoked with the caller's arguments (e.g.
 * `release(err)`), preserving normal and double-release semantics.
